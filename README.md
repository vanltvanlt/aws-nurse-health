# COMP308-NursePatient-Portal-AI
## Nurse-Patient Monitoring System

## Project Overview

This group project focuses on building a modern web application to help **nurse practitioners** monitor patients during their post-hospitalization recovery period and allow **patients** to track their daily health activities. The app integrates cutting-edge **GraphQL APIs**, **deep learning**, and **emerging web frameworks** to provide an intelligent and user-friendly solution.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to:
- Design and code web applications using emerging web frameworks.
- Build a **GraphQL API** using **Express**.
- Develop a **React**-based front-end utilizing the GraphQL API.
- Apply appropriate design patterns and principles.
- Incorporate **deep learning** for intelligent data analysis.

---

## Tech Stack

### Server-Side
- **Node.js** & **Express.js**
- **GraphQL** API
- **TensorFlowJS** for deep learning integration
- **MongoDB** for data storage

### Client-Side
- **React 18.2+**
- **Bootstrap** for responsive design and styling

---

## Functionalities

### **1. User Registration/Login**
- Secure user authentication and session management.

### **2. Nurse Features**
- Record and update **vital signs**: body temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate.
- View historical clinical visit data for patients.
- Send **daily motivational tips** to patients.
- Utilize **deep learning models** for symptom analysis to generate potential medical conditions and alert patients if necessary.

### **3. Patient Features**
- Submit **emergency alerts** for first responders.
- Log **daily health metrics** as prescribed by the nurse practitioner (e.g., pulse rate, weight, etc.).
- Complete and submit a **symptom checklist** for illnesses like COVID-19 or RSV.

---

## Architecture

- **Back-End**: Microservices architecture using Express.js and GraphQL.
- **Front-End**: Micro-frontends architecture with React functional components.

---

## Design Considerations
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure compatibility across various devices using **React Bootstrap**.
- **TypeScript (Optional)**: Enhance code quality and maintainability.
- **Cloud Deployment**: Bonus marks for deploying the app to platforms like Heroku, Azure, or AWS.

---

## Database
- **MongoDB**: Use proper document structure and modeling to store user and application data efficiently.
